            <li>
              Collection of information which has been designated as ‘sensitive
              personal data or information’ under the SPI Rules requires your
              express consent. By affirming your assent to this Privacy Policy,
              you provide your consent to such collection as required under

            <li>
              Jeevone may require the User to pay with a credit card, wire
              transfer, debit card or cheque for Services for which subscription
              amount(s) is/are payable. Jeevone may collect such User’s credit
              card number and/or other financial institution information such as
              bank account numbers and will use that information for the billing
              and payment processes, including but not limited to the use and
              disclosure of such credit card number and information to third
              parties as necessary to complete such billing operation.
              Verification of credit information, however, is accomplished
              solely by the User through the authentication process. User’s
              credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon secure sites of
              approved payment gateways which are digitally under encryption,
              thereby providing the highest possible degree of care as per
              current technology. User is advised, however, that internet
              technology is not full proof safe and User should exercise
              discretion on using the same.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User

              a User used to access the World Wide Web), User’s computer
              operating system and type of web browser the User is using, email
              patterns, as well as the name of User’s ISP. This information is
              used to analyze overall trends to help Jeevone improve its
              Service. The linkage between User’s IP address and User’s
              personally identifiable information is not shared with third
              parties. Notwithstanding the above, Jeevone may share some of the

              (i.e., non-personally identifiable) with advertisers, sponsors,
              investors, strategic partners, and others in order to help grow
              its business.
